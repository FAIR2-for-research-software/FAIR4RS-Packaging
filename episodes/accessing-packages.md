### Python Package Index (PyPI)

The Python Package Index or PyPI is an online repository of Python packages  hosting over 500,000 packages! While there are alternatives such as [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org), PyPI is by far the most commonly used and likely to have all you need.

pip (package installer for Python) is the standard tool for installing packages from PyPI. 
You can think of PyPI being the supermarket full of packages and pip being the delivery van brining it to your installation.
