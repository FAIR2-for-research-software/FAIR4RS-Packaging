- What is software packaging?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Recognise the importance of software packaging to ensure  reproducibility.
- Understand what are the basic building blocks of a Python package.

## Introduction

Now that we have covered the fundamentals of packaging in Python, we can start preparing to publish the package online for others to use. But before we do, we need to make sure our package contains the necessary files. To recap, let's review the basic directory we created back in episode one, which had the following structure:


```
ðŸ“¦ my_project/
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ my_package/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ init.py
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ docs/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ documentation.md
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ pyproject.toml
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ README.md
â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ LICENSE
```

### README 

Firstly, all packages must contain a `README.md` file that explains what the project is. how users can install it and how they can use it. A good example of a `README.md` file may look something like:

```

# My Python Project

My Python Project is a simple utility tool designed to perform basic operations on text files. Whether you need to count words, find specific phrases, or extract data, this tool has you covered.

## Installation

You can install My Python Project via pip:

$ pip install my-python-project

## Usage

from my_python_project import text_utils

text = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit."
word_count = text_utils.count_words(text)
print("Word count:", word_count)

This will output:

Word count: 9

```

Notice that the `README.md` should be included at the top level of our project directory. If your package was created using a `.toml` file, it should also be included in the metadata by adding in the following line:

``` toml

[project]
readme = "README.md"

```

In the `README.md` file, developers also usually include in a "contributing" section for new users that are typically outside of the project. The purpose of this section is to encourage new developers to work on the project, while ensuring they follow the etiquette set by the project developers. This may look something like:

```
### Contributing

Contributions to My Python Project are welcome! If you'd like to contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature (git checkout -b feature/new-feature).
3. Make your changes and ensure tests pass.
4. Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Add new feature').
5. Push to the branch (git push origin feature/new-feature).
6. Create a new Pull Request.
```

### Licensing 

Following this, it is essential for your software to have a license to emphasise to users what their rights are in regards to usage and redistribution. The purpose of this is to provide the developer with some legal protections, if needed. There are many different open source licenses available, and it is up to the developer(s) to choose the apporpriate license. You can explore alternative open source licenses at [www.choosealicense.com](www.choosealicense.com). It is important to note that your selection of license may be influenced by the licenses of your dependencies. 

The most common license used in open source projects is the [MIT license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License). The MIT license is permissive, which allows users to freely use, modify, and distribute software while providing a disclaimer of liability.

As with the `README.md`, you can also add the license to your `pyproject.toml` file as:

``` toml

[project]
license = {file = "LICENSE"}

```
