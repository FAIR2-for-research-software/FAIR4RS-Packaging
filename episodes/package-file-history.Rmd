## Introduction

In this episode we are going to look at what turns your project of python code into a Python package. 
Throughout Pythons development there have been many different ways of doing this, we will aim to explore some of these. 
This is to both build an understanding of why the current standard is what it is and to have some context if you ever come across the other methods when looking at other projects.

Inline instructor notes can help inform instructors of timing challenges associated with the
lessons. They appear in the "Instructor View"

::: challenge
## Challenge 1: Can you do it?

What is the output of this command?

``` r
paste("This", "new", "lesson", "looks", "good")
```

::: solution
## Output

``` output
[1] "This new lesson looks good"
```
:::

## Challenge 2: how do you nest solutions within challenge blocks?

::: solution
You can add a line with at least three colons and a `solution` tag.

## Figures

You can include figures generated from R Markdown:

```{r pyramid, fig.alt = "pie chart illusion of a pyramid", fig.cap = "Sun arise each and every morning"}
pie(
  c(Sky = 78, "Sunny side of pyramid" = 17, "Shady side of pyramid" = 5), 
  init.angle = 315, 
  col = c("deepskyblue", "yellow", "yellow3"), 
  border = FALSE
)
```

Or you can use pandoc markdown for static figures with the following syntax:

`![optional caption that appears below the figure](figure url){alt='alt text for accessibility purposes'}`

## Math

One of our episodes contains $\LaTeX$ equations when describing how to create dynamic reports with
{knitr}, so we now use mathjax to describe this:

`$\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$` becomes: $\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$

Cool, right?

::: keypoints
-   Use `.md` files for episodes when you want static content
-   Use `.Rmd` files for episodes when you need to generate output
-   Run `sandpaper::check_lesson()` to identify any issues with your lesson
-   Run `sandpaper::build_lesson()` to preview your lesson locally
