## Introduction

In this episode we are going to look at what turns your project of python code into a Python package. 
Throughout Pythons development there have been many different ways of doing this, we will aim to explore some of these. 
This is to both build an understanding of why the current standard is what it is and to have some context if you ever come across the other methods when looking at other projects.

## What Python packaging files exist?

1. requirements.txt
2. setup.py
3. setup.cfg
4. pyproject.toml

:::

## Requirements.txt

A `requirements.txt` is a text file where each line represents a package or library that your project depends on. A package managing tool like PIP can use this file to install all the necessary dependencies. 

While a requirements.txt file isn't normally directly used for packaging, its a simple and common filetype that offers some of the features that the packaging files do.

```
requests==2.26.0
numpy>=1.21.0
matplotlib<4.0
```

## Setup.py

Before the introduction of `pyproject.toml` the main tool supported for installing packages was `setup.py`. As the extension suggests a `setup.py` is a python file where the metadata and logic for building your package are contained.

### Setup.py problems

Q: Discuss with each other what problems if any you think there may be with using a python file to create python packages

`Hint: Think about the differences between a code file and a text file`

::: solution

Some potential issues are:
1. As `setup.py` is a code file, there is a potential for malicious code to be hidden in them if the file comes from an untrusted source
2. There is quite a bit of 'boilerplate' in each file
3. The syntax has to be precise and may be confusing to those not familiar with Python

```python
from setuptools import setup

setup(
  name='my_cool_package',
  version='1.0.0',
  description='A package to do awesome things',
  long_description=open('README.md').read(),
  author='John Doe',
  author_email='john.doe@example.com',
  license='MIT',
  # Look for configuration in a setup.cfg file (optional)
  setup_cfg=True,
  # Dependencies can be defined here or in setup.cfg
  # install_requires=['pandas', 'numpy']
)
```

## Setup.cfg

To tackle some of the problems with `setup.py`, another standard file was introduced called `setup.cfg`.
