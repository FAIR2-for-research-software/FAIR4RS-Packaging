## Introduction

In this episode we are going to look at what turns your project of python code into a Python package. 
Throughout Pythons development there have been many different ways of doing this, we will aim to explore some of these. 
This is to both build an understanding of why the current standard is what it is and to have some context if you ever come across the other methods when looking at other projects.

## What Python packaging files exist?

1. requirements.txt
2. setup.py
3. setup.cfg
4. pyproject.toml

:::

## Requirements.txt

A requirements.txt is a text file where each line represents a package or library that your project depends on. A package managing tool like PIP can use this file to install all the necessary dependancies. 

While a requirements.txt file isn't normally directly used for packaging, its a simple and common filetype that offers some of the features that the packaging files do.
