# Research Software Documentation

This repository contains a course on documenting research software that is part of the [training provision for research computing](https://sites.google.com/sheffield.ac.uk/research-training/) at the University of Sheffield.

## Course description

Research software is increasingly becoming a key and fundamental part of research. There is a growing recognition that research software would benefit from adhering to the FAIR principles which is the main motivation behind the FAIR4RS (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable for Research Software) principles. This is an extension of the FAIR principles, which acknowledges the applicability of the FAIR approach to research software. Software packaging has many benefits, such as enabling your research software to be discovered, installed, and utilised with ease.  The course will explore the fundamental concepts of FAIR4RS, how it applies to packaging, its execution within Python, and the adoption of best practices in this domain.


## Course overview

This course introduces the importance of packaging in the context of research software reproducibility. In particular, the course outline is:

1. Overview FAIR4RS and Software Packaging
2. History of Python Packaging
3. Accessing Packages
4. Versioning
5. Publishing Python Packages


## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Python
