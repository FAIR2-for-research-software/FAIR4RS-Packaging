## Summary

Packaging your software is one of the most important steps in a software project to make it both findable and accessible. This course will provide you with an understanding of why and when packaging is useful, what different standards exist to package Python projects and take you through each step of the packaging process.

## Software Setup

### Python 3

This session will be using Python 3 as the language for examples and demonstrations. 

Python can be downloaded from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/), versions 3.11 or newer are recommended. 

### Terminal

A terminal interface will also be required, listed below are the recommended ones for each OS. 
Although terminal commands aren't an explicit part of the lesson if you are unfamiliar with them guidance will be available during the session. 
This [carpentries lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) is also a good starting place to learn.

### Windows
Use Command Prompt or PowerShell.

- Located in Start Menu, or by typing "cmd" or "powershell" in the search bar.
- Basic commands: `dir` (list files), `cd` (change directory), `cls` (clear screen).
- To confirm if Python is available, type `python --version` in Command Prompt or PowerShell. 
- If Python is correctly installed, you should see the correct version number printed in your terminal.

### MacOS

Use Terminal.app.

- Located in Applications → Utilities → Terminal, or open using `Cmd+Space` and type "Terminal".
- Basic commands: `ls` (list files), `cd` (change directory), `clear` (clear screen).
- To confirm if Python is available, type `python3 --version` in your terminal.
- On newer macOS installations, try both `python --version` and `python3 --version`. If it's correctly installed, you should see the correct version number printed in your terminal.

### Linux

Use Terminal

- Open with `Ctrl+Alt+T` or find it in application menu (often called "Terminal", or GNOME Terminal").
- Basic commands: `ls` (list files), `cd` (change directory), `clear` (clear screen).
- To confirm if Python is available, type `python3 --version` in your terminal.
- On some distributions, `python` may refer to Python 2, so use `python3` to be specific. If it's correctly installed, you should see the correct version number printed in your terminal.
